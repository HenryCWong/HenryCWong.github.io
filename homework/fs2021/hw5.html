      <h1 style="text-align:center"> Homework 5</h1>
      <h2 style="text-align:center"> Due: October 15th, 2021 12:00pm</h2>
      <hr border-color="black">
       
      <h2> Background </h2>
      <p>The Codemon Academy is incredibly satisfied with your work (give yourself a pat on the back...because we can’t afford to pay you anything else). So the academy wants to up their security system to <strike>get control</strike> make students safer. </p>
      <p>To up their security system, the academy has introduced “zones” with a sign-in system that logs the profile of the entrant as they enter the zone. A zone is a specific section of the academy. Each zone should only be entered by specific people. However, a few rascals sometimes sneak past the security guards. To catch these meddling brats, the academy has installed an entrant detection system that gives them information on each entrant. 
This information will be outputted to a log file which will be provided. There will be one log file for each zone. </p>   

      <h2>Specifications</h2>
      <p>This homework will build off the last assignment with a few additions. One of the big ones being that you will no longer be taking input from standard in (cin). Instead you will be taking input from FILES! 
The files can be found here under “Homework 5” on this website. </p>
      
      <p>In order to get all the data,  all you have to do is issue these commands from the directory in which you want the files to reside:</p>

      <pre>wget https://henrycwong.com/homework/fs2021/hw5/the_library.log
wget https://henrycwong.com/homework/fs2021/hw5/training_room.log
wget https://henrycwong.com/homework/fs2021/hw5/faculty_lounge.log 
wget https://henrycwong.com/homework/fs2021/hw5/the_chamber_of_ekans.log</pre>

      <h3>Zones</h3>
      <p>The Codemon Academy has only introduced 4 different zones so far (potentially more to come). </p>
      <ol>
        <li> The Library </li>
        <li> Training Room </li>
        <li> Faculty <strike>Rager</strike> Lounge </li>
        <li> The Chamber of Ekans (for even more copyright infringement) </li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>You will need to create a struct to represent the zones. To get data for each zone, each zone will have its own log file. Therefore, you will be required to read through 4 files that are provided. </p>
      <p>Each zone and entrant will be assigned a “security level” ranging from 1-4. The Library has a security level of 1, the Training Room with a security level of 2, the Faculty Lounge with a security level of 3, and finally The Chamber of Ekans with a security of 4. The higher the number, the more strict the security is.</p>
      <p> Each zone will also have a name and a “total number of potential violations”, which is the total number of potential violations that have occurred within that specific zone.  </p>
      
      <h3>Potential Violations</h3>
      <p>You are to detect whenever there is a potential violation and provide a warning in the output file. </p>
      <p> A potential violation is committed if: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>the entrant is at or over the age of 30 and tries to enter as a student</li>
        <li>an entrant is logged as entering a zone with a security level higher than themselves
          <ul>
            <li> e.g. a student with a security level of 2 is logged to have entered the Faculty Lounge will result in a violation </li>
            <li> To do this <b>you will be required to overload operator(s)</b></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> The number of codemon an entrant has is greater than the 3rd quartile of all codemon within the zone the entrant has entered. </li>
      </ol>
      
      <h4><b>Finding the 3rd Quartile</b> </h4>
      <p>To find the quartile of an array, you must:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Sort the array (sorting should be its own function)</li>
        <li>Find the index of the 3rd quartile by calculating <code>(3/4) * (<i>n</i>+1) where <i>n</i> </code> is the number of useful data
          <ul>
            <li>Find what element is in the index found from the formula above</li>
            <li> If the index is not a full number, round down to the nearest integer </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <p>The number at the index calculated will be the 3rd quartile. </p>
      </ol>
      
      <h3> Recording Warning/Potential Violations </h3>
      <p>To record these warnings. You will write to a file specifically for the zone where the potential violation occurred. Therefore, you will be writing to 4 different files, each called the_library_warnings.txt, training_room_warnings.txt, faculty_lounge_warnings.txt, and the_chamber_of_ekans_warnings.txt.</p>
      <p>The warnings per zone will be placed in their respective files. </p>
      <p> Each warning will contain the following information in order: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The name of the person causing the violation (first name, last name)</li>
        <li>Age of entrant</li>
        <li>Occupation of Entrant</li>
        <li>Number of Codemon Owned</li>
        <li>Securtiy Level of Entrant</li>
        <li>They type of potential violation
          <ul>
            <li> <code>Classified as Student at age <i>X</i> </code></li>
            <li> <code>Entrant with level of <i>Y</i> eneterd a zone of level <i>Z</i> </code></li>
            <li> <code>Entrant has too many codemon, entrant has <i>A</i> codemon, the third quartile is <i>B</i> </code></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Notice the format is similar to the printEntrant function in the previous homework. However, for this homework <b>we will expect you to overload the << operator.</b></p>
      <p> If one entrant has more than one warning, treat each warning as a separate entity regardless of the entrant. Therefore, there will be one warning for each recorded potential violation. The order of which the warning should be presented first is in the following order: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>over age of 30 and occupation is “student”</li>
        <li>entrant has security level lower than zone</li>
        <li>number of codemon is greater than the third quartile</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>Therefore, in the output file, the first entrants to be listed are entrants who were over 30 and occupation was “student”. The next entrants listed will be entrants who have a security level less than the security level of the zone they entered. Finally, the last entrants listed in the output file will be entrants who had more Codemon than the 3rd quartile. </p>
      <p>You will then have a “summary” section that will print out each zone followed by the total number of violations for that zone in descending order. </p>
      
      <h2>Example Output (To Stantard Out): </h2>
      <pre>
Summary

Training Room: 8 potential violations
The Chamber of Ekans: 3 potential violations
The Library: 2 potential violations
Faculty Lounge: 0 potential violations
      </pre>

      <h2>Algorithm</h2>
      <pre>
Read in input from first zone
Store data as appropriate
For every potential violation
    record a warning in the output file
Repeat 1-3 for every input file
Print out the number of total violations per zone in descending order
      </pre>
      
      <h2>Note: </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Due to traffic constraints, it is impossible for more than 100 entrants to enter a zone in a day. </li>
        <li>Sort should be its own function.</li>
        <li>Feel free to use whichever sorting function whether we taught it or not. Just don’t use bogo sort...please. Bubble sort is easy to code. </li>
        <li>Each warning will be its own entry. Therefore, if one person has more than one violation, this will show up as two separate warnings in the output file. </li>
        <li>There should be no output to standard out except for the zones printing in descending order at the end of your program. All output will go to the output files. </li>
        <li>The input files are just text files. </li>
        <li>We will not grade on just the files given. We may have other files that we don’t show you guys for grading purposes. So you might want to generate your own files to test your code. </li>
      </ul>
