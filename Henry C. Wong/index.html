				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Who am I?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Hello, my name is Henry Wong. I like to call myself ambitious but most of the time I am just really curious.  </p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How did I get into computer programming?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p> In the past I used to live in not good but not bad part of New Jersey. Going outside wasn't the best option for anybody, especially a kid. So I spent my time with studying books, Legos, and computers.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> What I have done in the past few years </a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p> I mostly volunteer at the local hospital as an IT nowadays. I also code or test for Mozzila whenever they call for it. I have written a few codes from here and there but most of them aren't worth mentioning.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What are my plans for the future?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p> I am planning on continuing my studies because I am far from it. My primary objective right now to learn as much as I can about programming and what different programs can accomplish. Thus I want to get as much internships as I can for now so I can learn what I cannot learn in school.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Hobbies</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p> I spend most of my days learning about all different kinds of things about technology, recently it has been mainly programming. In my free time I am either watching movies, playing video games (mainly League of Legends but I like to explore my options), clicking away on my camera, or playing whatever music I seem to listen to.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">My History With Gaming</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>My first experience with video games was when I was 3 years old. My dad had picked up one of those shady copies that have “over 99 games” on the cd for free at a Chinese New Year festival. My dad picked me up and sat me down on his lap in front of our computer running on Windows 98 (2000 hadn’t come out yet). The only game he recognized and picked to play was Doom II, not the most kid friendly game. Although my dad probably didn’t care much for the moment, this moment would peak my interest in computer programming.

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is your favourite genre of games?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>My favourite genre of games and video games change from time to time. Just 3 years ago I was playing a lot of Magic: The Gathering and playing hardcore Starcraft. Now I play some Dominion and a mix of tons of different indie games and the occasional League of Legends. I just like exploring the different type of games multiple extremely talented people in this world have to offer. </p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What languages do you speak?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p> My primary language when I was a kid was Cantonese. But, after moving to the Midwest I started to speak a lot more English and therefore I now have an accent whenever I speak any Asian language. I know enough Mandarin Chinese to order food and hold some conversations. I am currently trying to learn Japanese.</p>
